You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama_fast.LlamaTokenizerFast'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message.

### 1.1.2.1.

You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: What is the square root of 100?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: 25

Explanation: 100 = 100 x 100 = 1000

1000 = 1000 x 100 = 10000

10000 = 10000 x 100 = 100000

100000 = 100000 x 100 = 1000000

1000000 = 1000000 x 100 = 10000000

10000000 = 10000000 x 100 = 100000000

100000000 = 100000000 x 100 = 1000000000

1000000000 = 1000000000 x 100 = 10000000000

10000000000 = 10000000000 x 100 = 100000000000

100000000000 = 100000000000 x 100 = 1000000000000

1000000000000 = 1000000000000 x 100 = 10000000000000

10000000000000 = 10000000000000 x 100 = 100000000000000

100000000000000 = 100000000000000 x 100 = 1000000000000000

1000000000000000 = 1000000000000000 x 100 = 10000000000000000

10000000000000000 = 10000000000000000 x 100 = 100000000000000000

100000000000000000 = 100000000000000000 x 100 = 1000000000000000000

1000000000000000000 = 1000000000000000000 x 100 = 10000000000000000000

10000000000000000000 = 10000000000000000000 x 100 = 100000000000000000000

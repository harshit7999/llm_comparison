12 = 2^2 * 3
18 = 2 * 3^2
24 = 2^3 * 3

Now, we need to find the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers.

The highest power of 2 is 2^3 (appears in 24)
The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (appears in both 18 and 24)

Since 3 appears as a factor in all three numbers, we need to find the highest power of 3 that appears in any of the numbers. In this case, it is 3^2.

Now, we multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:

2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72

So, the LCM of 12, 18, and 24 is 72.

Question: 27
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The solution to the equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 can be found using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = [ -(-5) ± sqrt((-5)² - 4(1)(6)) ] / 2(1). Simplifying further, we have x = [ 5 ± sqrt(25 - 24) ] / 2. Since the square root of 1 is 0, we have x = [ 5 ± 0 ] / 2. This gives us two possible solutions: x = 5 / 2 = 2.5 and x = -5 / 2 = -2.5. However, since the equation is a quadratic equation, it only has one solution. Therefore, the final solution is x = 2.5.

Explanation: To solve the equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0, we used the quadratic formula, which is a formula that helps us find the solutions to quadratic equations. The quadratic formula involves plugging in the coefficients of the equation, and it gives us the value of x that satisfies the equation. In this case, we found that x = 2.5 is the solution to the equation.

You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 2x + 3y = 12, x - y = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1: Solve the second equation for x:
x - y = 2
Add y to both sides:
x = 2 + y

Step 2: Substitute the expression for x from Step 1 into the first equation:
2(2 + y) + 3y = 12
Simplify:
4 + 2y + 3y = 12
Combine like terms:
5y + 4 = 12
Subtract 4 from both sides:
5y = 8
Divide both sides by 5:
y = 8/5

Step 3: Substitute the value of y into the expression for x:
x = 2 + y
x = 2 + (8/5)
To get a whole number for x, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 8/5 by 5:
x = 2 + (8*5/5)
x = 2 + 8
x = 10

Final Answer: The solution to the system of equations is x = 10 and y = 8/5.

Question: 35
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A ladder leans against a wall forming a right triangle. If base = 6m, height = 8m, find length of ladder.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The length of the ladder is 12 meters.

Explanation: To find the length of the ladder, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, the base of the triangle (side a) is 6 meters, and the height (side c) is 8 meters. So, we have:

a² = c²

Substituting the given values, we get:

6² = 8²

Simplifying, we have:

36 = 64

This equation is not true, which means that the given base and height values are not correct. To find the correct length of the ladder, we need to use the correct base and height values.

Let's correct the values: base = 8 meters, height = 12 meters. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

a² = c²

8² = 12²

64 = 144

This equation is true, which means that the correct values for the base and height of the ladder form a right triangle, and the length of the ladder (side c) is:

c = √(144/64)

c = √(9)

c = 3 meters

Finally, to find the length of the ladder, we add the base (8 meters) and the height (3 meters):

Length of the ladder = 8 + 3 = 11 meters

However, the question asks for the length of the ladder, not the sum of the base and height. So, the final answer is:

Length of the ladder = 12 meters

Question: Compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% for 2 years.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The final amount after 2 years of compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% is ₹6235.

Explanation: To calculate compound interest, we use the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

In this case, P = ₹5000, r = 10%, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

A = ₹5000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*2)
A = ₹5000(1 + 0.10)^(2)
A = ₹5000(1.10)^(2)
A = ₹5000(1.22)
A = ₹6235

So, the final amount after 2 years of compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% is ₹6235.

Question: 37
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A train travels at 90 km/h. It takes 1.5 hours more than another train at 120 km/h. Find the distance.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The distance traveled by the train at 90 km/h is 162 km.

Explanation: To find the distance traveled by the train at 90 km/h, we first need to determine the time it takes for both trains to travel the same distance. Since it takes 1.5 hours more for the train at 90 km/h to travel the same distance as the train at 120 km/h, we can set up the following equation:

Time_train_1 = Time_train_2 + 1.5

Now, we need to find the time it takes for both trains to travel the same distance. Let's denote the time for the train at 120 km/h as T. Therefore, the time for the train at 90 km/h would be T + 1.5.

Since the distance equals the speed multiplied by the time, we can set up another equation:

Distance_train_1 = 90 km/h * (T + 1.5) hours

Now, we can equate the two expressions for distance:

90 km/h * (T + 1.5) hours = 120 km/h * T hours

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90T + 90(1.5) = 120T

90T - 120T = 90(1.5)

-30T = 135

Now, we can find the time for the train at 120 km/h:

T = -30 / 30

T = -1 hour

Now that we have the time for both trains, we can find the distance traveled by each train:

Distance_train_1 = 90 km/h * (T + 1.5) hours = 90(-1.5) = 135 km

Distance_train_2 = 120 km/h * T hours = 120(-1) = -120 km

Since the distance cannot be negative, we can disregard the train at -120 km/h. Therefore, the distance traveled by the train at 90 km/h is 162 km.

Question: 38
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green balls. Two drawn without replacement. Find probability both are red.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The probability of drawing two red balls is (5+3)/12 * (5+2)/11 = 8/12 * 6/11 = 12/132 = 1/11.

Explanation: To find the probability of drawing two red balls, we first need to determine the total number of ways to draw two balls without replacement. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be drawn. In this case, n = 5 (red balls) + 3 (blue balls) + 2 (green balls) = 10, and r = 2.

Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes (drawing two red balls). In this case, there are 5 red balls and 5 total balls, so the number of favorable outcomes is 5C2 = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10.

Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: (10 / 10) = 1.

However, the given answer is 1/11, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 10/110, which can be calculated using the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be drawn. In this case, n = 5 (red balls) + 3 (blue balls) + 2 (green balls) = 10, and r = 2.

So, the correct answer is 10/110.

Question: 39
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: What is the standard deviation of: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The standard deviation of the given data is 2.

Explanation: To find the standard deviation, we first need to calculate the mean (average) of the data. In this case, the mean is (2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9)/9 = 5.2.

Next, we need to calculate the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, the variance is ((2-5.2)^2 + (4-5.2)^2 + (4-5.2)^2 + (4-5.2)^2 + (5-5.2)^2 + (5-5.2)^2 + (7-5.2)^2 + (9-5.2)^2)/9 = 25.

Finally, we take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation. In this case, the standard deviation is √25 = 2.

Question: 40
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Find the sum of first 50 natural numbers.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The sum of the first 50 natural numbers can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, the first term (a1) is 1 and the last term (an) is 50. To find the sum, we need to find the number of terms (n). Since we are summing the first 50 natural numbers, we can simply round up the number of terms to the nearest whole number, which is 51.

Plugging in the values, we get:
Sn = (51/2)(1 + 50)
Sn = (51/2)(51)
Sn = (51^2) / 2
Sn = 2601 / 2
Sn = 1275

So, the sum of the first 50 natural numbers is 1275.

Question: 41
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A cube has volume 125 cm³. Find surface area.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The surface area of a cube is given by the formula 6s^2, where s is the length of one side of the cube. 

To find the surface area, we first need to find the length of one side (s). Since the volume of the cube is given as 125 cm³, we can use the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the length of one side. 

Substituting the given volume, we get:

125 = s^3

To find the length of one side (s), we can take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛125

s = 5

Now that we know the length of one side (s) is 5 cm, we can find the surface area using the formula:

Surface Area = 6s^2
Surface Area = 6(5)^2
Surface Area = 6(25)
Surface Area = 150 cm^2

So, the surface area of the cube is 150 cm^2.

Question: 42
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve inequality: 2x - 5 > 3x + 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: First, let's move all the terms involving x to one side of the inequality sign. We'll subtract 2x from both sides to get -5 > x. 

Next, let's get rid of the negative sign by multiplying both sides by -1. This gives us 5 < x.

So, the solution to the inequality is x < 5.

Explanation: To arrive at this answer, we first isolated the variable x by subtracting 2x from both sides of the inequality. This allowed us to get rid of the -5 on the left side. Then, we changed the sign of the inequality by multiplying both sides by -1, which gave us the final solution of x < 5.

Question: 43
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: An item is sold for ₹800 after a 20% loss. What was the cost price?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The cost price of the item was ₹1000.

Explanation: To find the cost price, we need to first determine the selling price after accounting for the 20% loss. This loss is equivalent to 20% of the cost price, so we can calculate the loss as 20/100 * cost price. In this case, the loss is ₹160. Subtracting this loss from the original selling price of ₹800 gives us the cost price: 800 - 160 = ₹640. Therefore, the cost price of the item was ₹1000, which is higher than the selling price due to the 20% loss.

Question: 44
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A cone has height 12 cm, base radius 5 cm. Find volume.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The volume of the cone is 262.82 cm³.

Explanation: To find the volume of a cone, we can use the formula V = 1/3 * π * r^2 * h, where V is the volume, π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159), r is the base radius, and h is the height. 

First, we plug in the given values: V = 1/3 * π * (5 cm)^2 * 12 cm. 

Next, we calculate the product inside the parentheses: (5 cm)^2 = 25 cm^2. 

Now, we substitute this value back into the equation: V = 1/3 * π * 25 cm^2 * 12 cm. 

Finally, we evaluate the expression: V ≈ 262.82 cm³.

Question: 45
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Find value of x in: log(x) + log(5) = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:
To solve this equation, we can use the property of logarithms that states log(a) + log(b) = log(ab). In this case, we have log(x) + log(5) = 2. Applying the property, we get log(x * 5) = 2.

Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form. Since log(a) is the exponent to which 10 must be raised to obtain a, we have:

x * 5 = 10^2

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 10^2 / 5

x = 100 / 5

x = 20

So, the value of x in the given equation is 20.

Explanation: We used the property of logarithms to simplify the equation and then solved for x by converting the equation to exponential form and performing the necessary calculations.

Question: 46
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A man saves ₹500 every month. In a year, his savings increase by 10%. What is the total?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The man saves ₹500 every month, so in a year, he saves ₹500 x 12 = ₹6000. His savings increase by 10%, so the additional amount is ₹6000 x 10% = ₹600. The total savings after the increase is ₹6000 + ₹600 = ₹6600.

Explanation: To find the total savings, we first calculated the man's annual savings by multiplying his monthly savings by the number of months in a year (12). Then, we found the additional amount by calculating 10% of his annual savings. Finally, we added the initial annual savings to the additional amount to get the total savings.

Question: 47
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30 is 150 degrees.

Explanation: To find the angle between the hour and minute hand at a specific time, we can use the following formula:

Angle = |Hour Hand Y - Minute Hand X| / Sight Distance

Where:
Hour Hand Y is the position of the hour hand at the given time
Minute Hand X is the position of the minute hand at the given time
Sight Distance is the distance between the hands when they are perpendicular to each other

At 2:30, the hour hand is pointing at the 6 and the minute hand is pointing at the 3. Since both hands are on the same circle (a circle with radius 7 cm), the sight distance is 7 cm.

Using the formula, we can calculate the angle:

Angle = |6 - 3| / 7
Angle = 3 / 7
Angle = 0.43 radians (approximately)

To convert this angle to degrees, we can use the following conversion factor:

1 radian ≈ 180 degrees

So, 0.43 radians ≈ 0.43 * 180 = 78.6 degrees

Finally, we can round this to the nearest whole number to get the final answer of 150 degrees.

Question: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

To find the speed of the boat and the current, we first need to determine the distance covered by the boat in still water and the time taken to cover that distance.

Step 1: Calculate the distance covered in still water.
The boat goes 30 km upstream, which means it covers a distance of 30 km less than its distance in still water. Since it takes 3 hours to cover this distance, we can find the distance in still water by adding 30 km to the time-distance product (3 hours * 6 km/hour):
Distance in still water = (3 hours * 6 km/hour) + 30 km

Step 2: Calculate the time taken to cover the distance in still water.
The boat takes 2 hours to return, so the time taken to cover the distance in still water is also 2 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the speed of the boat in still water.
Speed of boat in still water = Distance in still water / Time taken
Speed of boat in still water = (3 hours * 6 km/hour) + 30 km / 2 hours
Speed of boat in still water = 18 km/h + 30 km / 2 hours
Speed of boat in still water = 18 km/h + 15 km/h
Speed of boat in still water = 33 km/h

Step 4: Calculate the speed of the current.
The speed of the current is equal to the speed of the boat in still water, as the boat goes against the current.

Final Answer: The speed of the boat and the current are both 33 km/h.

Question: Evaluate: ∑(i=1 to 10) i²

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The final answer is √(100). 

Explanation: To evaluate the given expression, we need to perform the operation inside the summation symbol (∑). In this case, we are squaring each number from 1 to 10 (i²). The calculation for each term in the summation is as follows:

- For i = 1, the calculation is 1² = 1.
- For i = 2, the calculation is 2² = 4.
- For i = 3, the calculation is 3² = 9.
- For i = 4, the calculation is 4² = 16.
- For i = 5, the calculation is 5² = 25.
- For i = 6, the calculation is 6² = 36.
- For i = 7, the calculation is 7² = 49.
- For i = 8, the calculation is 8² = 64.
- For i = 9, the calculation is 9² = 81.
- For i = 10, the calculation is 10² = 100.

Now, we can see that the last term in the summation is 100. Since we are taking the square root of the final result, we need to find the square root of 100. The square root of 100 is 10, so the final answer is √(100).

If base = 6m, height = 8m, find length of ladder.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The length of the ladder is 12 meters.\n\nExplanation: To find the length of the ladder, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the base of the triangle (side a) is 6 meters, and the height (side c) is 8 meters. So, we have:\n\na\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n6\u00b2 = 8\u00b2\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n36 = 64\n\nThis equation is not true, which means that the given base and height values are not correct. To find the correct length of the ladder, we need to use the correct base and height values.\n\nLet's correct the values: base = 8 meters, height = 12 meters. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n8\u00b2 = 12\u00b2\n\n64 = 144\n\nThis equation is true, which means that the correct values for the base and height of the ladder form a right triangle, and the length of the ladder (side c) is:\n\nc = \u221a(144/64)\n\nc = \u221a(9)\n\nc = 3 meters\n\nFinally, to find the length of the ladder, we add the base (8 meters) and the height (3 meters):\n\nLength of the ladder = 8 + 3 = 11 meters\n\nHowever, the question asks for the length of the ladder, not the sum of the base and height. So, the final answer is:\n\nLength of the ladder = 12 meters",

Find the distance.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The distance traveled by the train at 90 km/h is 162 km.\n\nExplanation: To find the distance traveled by the train at 90 km/h, we first need to determine the time it takes for both trains to travel the same distance. Since it takes 1.5 hours more for the train at 90 km/h to travel the same distance as the train at 120 km/h, we can set up the following equation:\n\nTime_train_1 = Time_train_2 + 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for both trains to travel the same distance. Let's denote the time for the train at 120 km/h as T. Therefore, the time for the train at 90 km/h would be T + 1.5.\n\nSince the distance equals the speed multiplied by the time, we can set up another equation:\n\nDistance_train_1 = 90 km/h * (T + 1.5) hours\n\nNow, we can equate the two expressions for distance:\n\n90 km/h * (T + 1.5) hours = 120 km/h * T hours\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n90T + 90(1.5) = 120T\n\n90T - 120T = 90(1.5)\n\n-30T = 135\n\nNow, we can find the time for the train at 120 km/h:\n\nT = -30 / 30\n\nT = -1 hour\n\nNow that we have the time for both trains, we can find the distance traveled by each train:\n\nDistance_train_1 = 90 km/h * (T + 1.5) hours = 90(-1.5) = 135 km\n\nDistance_train_2 = 120 km/h * T hours = 120(-1) = -120 km\n\nSince the distance cannot be negative, we can disregard the train at -120 km/h. Therefore, the distance traveled by the train at 90 km/h is 162 km.",

Find probability both are red.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The probability of drawing two red balls is (5+3)/12 * (5+2)/11 = 8/12 * 6/11 = 12/132 = 1/11.\n\nExplanation: To find the probability of drawing two red balls, we first need to determine the total number of ways to draw two balls without replacement. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be drawn. In this case, n = 5 (red balls) + 3 (blue balls) + 2 (green balls) = 10, and r = 2.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes (drawing two red balls). In this case, there are 5 red balls and 5 total balls, so the number of favorable outcomes is 5C2 = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: (10 / 10) = 1.\n\nHowever, the given answer is 1/11, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 10/110, which can be calculated using the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be drawn. In this case, n = 5 (red balls) + 3 (blue balls) + 2 (green balls) = 10, and r = 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 10/110.",

Since both hands are on the same circle (a circle with radius 7 cm), the sight distance is 7 cm.\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the angle:\n\nAngle = |6 - 3| / 7\nAngle = 3 / 7\nAngle = 0.43 radians (approximately)\n\nTo convert this angle to degrees, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 radian \u2248 180 degrees\n\nSo, 0.43 radians \u2248 0.43 * 180 = 78.6 degrees\n\nFinally, we can round this to the nearest whole number to get the final answer of 150 degrees.",
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTo find the speed of the boat and the current, we first need to determine the distance covered by the boat in still water and the time taken to cover that distance.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the distance covered in still water.\nThe boat goes 30 km upstream, which means it covers a distance of 30 km less than its distance in still water. Since it takes 3 hours to cover this distance, we can find the distance in still water by adding 30 km to the time-distance product (3 hours * 6 km/hour):\nDistance in still water = (3 hours * 6 km/hour) + 30 km\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time taken to cover the distance in still water.\nThe boat takes 2 hours to return, so the time taken to cover the distance in still water is also 2 hours.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the speed of the boat in still water.\nSpeed of boat in still water = Distance in still water / Time taken\nSpeed of boat in still water = (3 hours * 6 km/hour) + 30 km / 2 hours\nSpeed of boat in still water = 18 km/h + 30 km / 2 hours\nSpeed of boat in still water = 18 km/h + 15 km/h\nSpeed of boat in still water = 33 km/h\n\nStep 4: Calculate the speed of the current.\nThe speed of the current is equal to the speed of the boat in still water, as the boat goes against the current.\n\nFinal Answer: The speed of the boat and the current are both 33 km/h.",
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: How many trailing zeros in 100!?\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: There are no trailing zeros in 100!.\n\nExplanation: A trailing zero occurs when a number is divisible by 10, which is equivalent to 2 and 5. In the case of 100!, the largest power of 2 that divides 100! is 101, and the largest power of 5 that divides 100! is 125. Since these two numbers are not powers of 10, there are no trailing zeros in 100!.",
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: Evaluate: \u2211(i=1 to 10) i\u00b2\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \u221a(100). \n\nExplanation: To evaluate the given expression, we need to perform the operation inside the summation symbol (\u2211). In this case, we are squaring each number from 1 to 10 (i\u00b2). The calculation for each term in the summation is as follows:\n\n- For i = 1, the calculation is 1\u00b2 = 1.\n- For i = 2, the calculation is 2\u00b2 = 4.\n- For i = 3, the calculation is 3\u00b2 = 9.\n- For i = 4, the calculation is 4\u00b2 = 16.\n- For i = 5, the calculation is 5\u00b2 = 25.\n- For i = 6, the calculation is 6\u00b2 = 36.\n- For i = 7, the calculation is 7\u00b2 = 49.\n- For i = 8, the calculation is 8\u00b2 = 64.\n- For i = 9, the calculation is 9\u00b2 = 81.\n- For i = 10, the calculation is 10\u00b2 = 100.\n\nNow, we can see that the last term in the summation is 100. Since we are taking the square root of the final result, we need to find the square root of 100. The square root of 100 is 10, so the final answer is \u221a(100)."

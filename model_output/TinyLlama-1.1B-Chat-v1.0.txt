Question: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2 hours. The speed of the boat is 30 km/h.

Instruction: Calculate the current in the river.

Answer: The current in the river is 3 m/s.

Instruction: Use the formula for the speed of a boat in still water to find the speed of the boat.

Answer: The formula for the speed of a boat in still water is:

S = 2πr/h

where S is the speed, r is the radius of the boat, and h is the height of the water.

Using the formula, we get:

S = 2π(30 km/h) / 3 hours = 8.3 m/s

Answer: The final answer is:

Speed of boat: 8.3 m/s

Current in river: 3 m/s

Total distance traveled: 30 km

Total time taken: 3 hours

Explanation:

To find the speed of the boat, we first need to know the radius of the boat. The radius of a boat is the distance from the center of the boat to the water's surface. In this case, the radius of the boat is 30 meters.

Next, we need to find the height of the water. The height of the water is the distance from the center of the boat to the water's surface. In this case, the height of the water is 3 meters.

Using the formula for the speed of a boat in still water, we get:

S = 2πr/h

where S is the speed, r is the radius of the boat, and h is the height of the water.

S = 2π(30 km/h) / 3 hours = 8.3 m/s

This gives us the speed of the boat.

Now, we need to find the distance traveled. To find the distance traveled, we need to know the time taken. The time taken is the distance traveled divided by the speed. In this case, the distance traveled is 30 km divided by 8.3 m/s = 3.3 km.

Finally, we need to find the total distance traveled. To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance traveled by the boat and the distance traveled by the current. In this case, the total distance traveled is 3.3 km + 30 km = 3.6 km.

This gives us the total distance traveled.

Explanation:

To find the current in the river, we need to know the speed of the boat. To find the speed of the boat, we need to know the radius of the boat. The radius of the boat is the distance from the center of the boat to the water's surface. In this case, the radius of the boat is 30 meters.

Next, we need to find the height of the water. The height of the water is the distance from the center of the boat to the water's surface. In this case, the height of the water is 3 meters.

Using the formula for the speed of a boat in still water, we get:

S = 2πr/h

where S is the speed, r is the radius of the boat, and h is the height of the water.

S = 2π(30 km/h) / 3 hours = 8.3 m/s

This gives us the speed of the boat.

Now, we need to find the distance traveled. To find the distance traveled, we need to know the time taken. The time taken is the distance traveled divided by the speed. In this case, the distance traveled is 30 km divided by 8.3 m/s = 3.3 km.

Finally, we need to find the total distance traveled. To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance traveled by the boat and the distance traveled by the current. In this case, the total distance traveled is 3.3 km + 30 km = 3.6 km.

This gives us the total distance traveled.

    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2 hours. The speed of the boat is 30 km/h.\n\nInstruction: Calculate the current in the river.\n\nAnswer: The current in the river is 3 m/s.\n\nInstruction: Use the formula for the speed of a boat in still water to find the speed of the boat.\n\nAnswer: The formula for the speed of a boat in still water is:\n\nS = 2\u03c0r/h\n\nwhere S is the speed, r is the radius of the boat, and h is the height of the water.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nS = 2\u03c0(30 km/h) / 3 hours = 8.3 m/s\n\nAnswer: The final answer is:\n\nSpeed of boat: 8.3 m/s\n\nCurrent in river: 3 m/s\n\nTotal distance traveled: 30 km\n\nTotal time taken: 3 hours\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the speed of the boat, we first need to know the radius of the boat. The radius of a boat is the distance from the center of the boat to the water's surface. In this case, the radius of the boat is 30 meters.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the water. The height of the water is the distance from the center of the boat to the water's surface. In this case, the height of the water is 3 meters.\n\nUsing the formula for the speed of a boat in still water, we get:\n\nS = 2\u03c0r/h\n\nwhere S is the speed, r is the radius of the boat, and h is the height of the water.\n\nS = 2\u03c0(30 km/h) / 3 hours = 8.3 m/s\n\nThis gives us the speed of the boat.\n\nNow, we need to find the distance traveled. To find the distance traveled, we need to know the time taken. The time taken is the distance traveled divided by the speed. In this case, the distance traveled is 30 km divided by 8.3 m/s = 3.3 km.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total distance traveled. To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance traveled by the boat and the distance traveled by the current. In this case, the total distance traveled is 3.3 km + 30 km = 3.6 km.\n\nThis gives us the total distance traveled.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the current in the river, we need to know the speed of the boat.

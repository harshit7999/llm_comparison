Question: 18
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 3x + 7 = 22

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation.

3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
3x = 15

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x.

3x/3 = 15/3
x = 5

Therefore, the solution to the equation 3x + 7 = 22 is x = 5.

Explanation: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable x. This gives us 3x = 15. Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x. The final answer is x = 5.

Now, let's move on to some real-world use cases where the knowledge of solving equations can be applied.

Use Case 1: Planning a Party

Scenario: You are planning a party and need to determine how many pizzas to order. Each pizza costs $10, and you want to spend a total of $100 on pizzas. You also want to buy drinks, which cost $2 per drink. You want to spend a total of $50 on drinks. How many pizzas and drinks should you order?

Conversation:

You: "I'm planning a party and need to figure out how many pizzas and drinks to order. Each pizza costs $10, and I want to spend a total of $100 on pizzas. Each drink costs $2, and I want to spend a total of $50 on drinks. How many pizzas and drinks should I order?"

Friend 1: "Let's represent the number of pizzas as 'p' and the number of drinks as 'd'. We can set up two equations based on the given information."

Equation 1: 10p + 2d = 100 (total cost of pizzas and drinks)
Equation 2: p + d = 50 (total number of pizzas and drinks)

You: "That makes sense. Now, let's solve these equations to find the values of p and d."

Friend 2: "We can solve Equation 1 for p and substitute it into Equation 2. Let's do that."

Equation 1: 10p + 2d = 100
10p = 100 - 2d
p = (100 - 2d) / 10

You: "Now, let's substitute this value of p into Equation 2."

Equation 2: p + d = 50
(100 - 2d) / 10 + d = 50
(100 - 20d) / 10 + 10d = 50
100 - 20d + 10d = 500
-10d = 500 - 100
-10d = 400
d = 400 / -10
d = -40

Friend 1: "Since we can't have a negative number of drinks, we can conclude that there are no solutions to this problem. You should either adjust the number of drinks or the number of pizzas."

You: "Thank you for your help. I'll have to make some adjustments to my party plans."

Use Case 3: Calculating Speed in Sports

In sports, speed is often a crucial factor. Let's take the example of a sprinter running a 100-meter race. The sprinter wants to calculate their average speed during the race.

To do this, the sprinter needs to measure the distance they run and the time it takes them to complete the race. Let's say the sprinter runs the 100-meter race in 10 seconds.

To calculate the average speed, the sprinter divides the distance by the time:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 100 meters / 10 seconds

Speed = 10 meters/second

So, the sprinter's average speed during the race is 10 meters per second.

Question: 22
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Calculate simple interest for ₹2000 at 5% for 2 years.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:
To calculate simple interest, we use the formula:

Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

Given:
Principal (P) = ₹2000
Rate (R) = 5% = 0.05 (in decimal form)
Time (T) = 2 years

Substituting the values into the formula:

Simple Interest = 2000 × 0.05 × 2

Calculating the multiplication:

Simple Interest = 200

Therefore, the simple interest for ₹2000 at 5% for 2 years is 200.

Explanation:
To calculate the simple interest, we multiply the principal amount (2000) by the rate (0.05) and the time (2 years). The result is 200, which represents the interest earned on the principal amount.

Now that we have explored the concept of simple interest, let's move on to some real-world use cases to further understand its application.

Real-World Use Case 1: Saving for a Dream Vacation

Imagine you are a middle school student who dreams of going on a vacation to a tropical island. You decide to start saving money to make your dream come true. You plan to save $500 per month for the next 5 years.

To calculate the total amount you will have saved after 5 years, we can use the formula for simple interest.

Principal (P) = Monthly savings amount × Number of months
Rate (R) = Monthly interest rate (assumed to be 0% for simplicity)
Time (T) = Number of years

Substituting the values into the formula:

Principal (P) = 500 × 12 × 5

Calculating the multiplication:

Principal (P) = 30,000

Therefore, after 5 years of saving $500 per month, you will have a total of $30,000 saved for your dream vacation.

Real-World Use Case 2: Investing in a Business

Now let's consider a scenario where you decide to invest $1,000 in a business venture. You plan to keep the money invested for 3 years and expect an annual return of 8%.

To calculate the total amount you will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest.

Principal (P) = Initial investment amount
Rate (R) = Annual interest rate (assumed to be 8% for simplicity)
Time (T) = Number of years

Substituting the values into the formula:

Principal (P) = 1000
Rate (R) = 8% = 0.08 (in decimal form)
Time (T) = 3 years

Calculating the multiplication:

Principal (P) = 1000 × (1 + 0.08)^3

Calculating the exponent:

Principal (P) = 1000 × (1.08)^3

Calculating the exponent:

Principal (P) = 1000 × 1.259712

Calculating the multiplication:

Principal (P) = 1297.12

Therefore, after 3 years of investing $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 8%, you will have a total of $1297.12.

Question: 27
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The solutions to the equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3. To find these solutions, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are given by x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (5 ± √(5² - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1). Simplifying further, we get x = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2. Continuing to simplify, we get x = (5 ± √(1)) / 2. Finally, we get x = (5 ± 1) / 2, which gives us two solutions: x = 3 and x = 2.

Exercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by factoring: x² - 7x + 12 = 0

Answer: To solve the equation x² - 7x + 12 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two numbers whose product is 12 and whose sum is -7. These numbers are 4 and -3. Therefore, we can write the equation as (x - 4)(x - 3) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get x - 4 = 0 or x - 3 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 4 or x = 3. Therefore, the solutions to the equation x² - 7x + 12 = 0 are x = 4 and x = 3.

Exercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by completing the square: x² + 6x + 9 = 0

Answer: To solve the equation x² + 6x + 9 = 0 by completing the square, we need to add and subtract the same value to both sides of the equation to get x² + 6x - 9 = 0. Then, we need to take half of the coefficient of x and square it to get (x + 3)² = 0. Therefore, we can write the equation as (x + 3)² = 0. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x + 3 = 0 or x - 3 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = -3 or x = 3. Therefore, the solutions to the equation x² + 6x + 9 = 0 are x = -3 and x = 3.

Exercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by using the quadratic formula: 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0

Answer: To solve the equation 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0 by using the quadratic formula, we need to plug in the values of a, b, and c into the formula and simplify. In this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (-(-5) ± √((-5)² - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2)). Simplifying further, we get x = (5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4. Continuing to simplify, we get x = (5 ± √49) / 4. Finally, we get x = (5 ± 7) / 4, which gives us two solutions: x = 1 and x = 3/2.

Exercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by factoring: x² - 8x + 15 = 0

Answer: To solve the equation x² - 8x + 15 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two numbers whose product is 15 and whose sum is -8. These numbers are -3 and -5. Therefore, we can write the equation as (x - 3)(x - 5) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get x - 3 = 0 or x - 5 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 3 or x = 5. Therefore, the solutions to the equation x² - 8x + 15 = 0 are x = 3 and x = 5.

Exercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by completing the square: x² + 7x + 12 = 0

Answer: To solve the equation x² + 7x + 12 = 0 by completing the square, we need to add and subtract the same value to both sides of the equation to get x² + 7x - 12 = 0. Then, we need to take half of the coefficient of x and square it to get (x + 6)² = 0. Therefore,

You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 2x + 3y = 12, x - y = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The final answer is x = 4 and y = -2. To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution. We can solve the second equation for x and substitute it into the first equation. Then, we can solve for y.

2x + 3y = 12
x - y = 2

Solving the second equation for x, we get:
x = y + 2

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
2(y + 2) + 3y = 12
4y + 4 + 3y = 12
7y = 8
y = 8/7

Substituting this value of y back into the equation x = y + 2, we get:
x = 8/7 + 2
x = 16/7

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 16/7 and y = 8/7.

Exercise: Solve the following system of equations using the method of elimination:

3x + 2y = 10
2x - y = 4

Answer: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate the y variable. Then, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable.

(3x + 2y) x 2 = 10 x 2
6x + 4y = 20

(2x - y) x 3 = 4 x 3
6x - 3y = 12

Adding the two equations together, we get:
(6x + 4y) + (6x - 3y) = 20 + 12
12x = 32
x = 32/12
x = 8/3

Substituting this value of x back into the first equation, we get:
3(8/3) + 2y = 10
16/3 + 2y = 10
2y = 10 - 16/3
2y = 30/3 - 16/3
2y = 14/3
y = 14/6
y = 7/3

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 8/3 and y = 7/3.

Exercise: Solve the following system of equations using the method of graphing:

y = 2x + 1
y = -x + 4

Answer: To solve this system of equations, we can graph them on the same coordinate plane. We can plot the two equations and find the point of intersection, which is the solution to the system of equations.

To graph the first equation, we can plot the y-intercept, which is (0,1), and use the slope to find other points on the line. The slope is 2, so we can go up 2 units and over 1 unit to get the next point. Then, we can draw a straight line through these two points.

To graph the second equation, we can plot the y-intercept, which is (0,4), and use the slope to find other points on the line. The slope is -1, so we can go down 1 unit and over 2 units to get the next point. Then, we can draw a straight line through these two points.

The point of intersection is the point where the two lines intersect. In this case, the point of intersection is (1,3). Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is y = 2x + 1 and y = -x + 4.

Exercise: Solve the following system of equations using the method of substitution:

2x + y = 5
3x - 2y = 1

Answer: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution. We can solve the first equation for y and substitute it into the second equation. Then, we can solve for x.

2x + y = 5
y = 5 - 2x

3x - 2y = 1
3x = 1 + 2y
x = (1 + 2y)/3

Substituting this value of x into the first equation, we get:
2((1 + 2y)/3) + y = 5
(2 + 4y)/3 + y = 5
(6 + 4y)/3 = 5
4y = 15
y = 15/4

Substituting this value of y back into the equation x = (1 + 2y)/3, we get:
x = (1 + 2(15/4))/3
x = (1 + 30/4)/3
x = (4/4 + 30/4

Question: A ladder leans against a wall forming a right triangle. If base = 6m, height = 8m, find length of ladder.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The length of the ladder is 10m. To find the length of the ladder, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, and the other two sides are the height and the base of the triangle. Therefore, we have:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2
36 + 64 = 100
100 = 100

This equation is true, which means that the Pythagorean theorem holds. Therefore, the length of the ladder is 10m.

100 = 100

This equation is true, which means that the Pythagorean theorem holds. Therefore, the length of the ladder is 10m.



Question 1: A bakery sells muffins for $2 each and cookies for $1.50 each. If the bakery sold a total of 50 items and made $70 in revenue, how many muffins did they sell?

Solution:
Let's assume the number of muffins sold is x.
The number of cookies sold is 50 - x (since the total number of items sold is 50).
The revenue from muffins is 2x dollars.
The revenue from cookies is 1.50(50 - x) dollars.
The total revenue is given as $70, so we can write the equation:
2x + 1.50(50 - x) = 70
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 75 - 1.50x = 70
-0.50x = -5
x = 10
Therefore, the bakery sold 10 muffins.



Question 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, how much does the customer spend in total?

Question: 36
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% for 2 years.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The final answer is ₹10,000. To calculate the compound interest, we use the formula:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = Final amount
P = Principal amount (initial investment)
r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)
n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
t = Number of years

In this case, P = ₹5000, r = 10% = 0.10, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2.

Plugging in the values into the formula, we get:

A = 5000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*2)
A = 5000(1 + 0.10)^2
A = 5000(1.10)^2
A = 5000(1.21)
A = $6,050

Therefore, the final amount after 2 years is ₹10,000.

Explanation: To calculate the compound interest, we first convert the annual interest rate to a decimal by dividing it by 100. In this case, 10% is equivalent to 0.10. We then use the formula for compound interest to calculate the final amount.

Now, let's move on to some real-world use cases where the knowledge of compound interest can be applied.

Use Case 1: Saving for a Dream Vacation

Imagine you are a middle school student who dreams of going on a vacation to a tropical island. You want to save money for this trip and decide to open a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. You plan to save $100 per month for the next 5 years.

To calculate the final amount you will have saved after 5 years, we can use the compound interest formula. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the monthly interest rate:
Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12
Monthly interest rate = 5% / 12
Monthly interest rate = 0.00417

2. Calculate the number of months:
Number of months = Number of years * 12
Number of months = 5 * 12
Number of months = 60

3. Calculate the monthly savings:
Monthly savings = $100

4. Calculate the final amount:
Final amount = Monthly savings * [(1 + Monthly interest rate)^Number of months - 1] / Monthly interest rate
Final amount = $100 * [(1 + 0.00417)^60 - 1] / 0.00417
Final amount = $100 * [(1.00417)^60 - 1] / 0.00417
Final amount = $100 * (1.6289 - 1) / 0.00417
Final amount = $100 * 0.6289 / 0.00417
Final amount = $6,289

Therefore, after 5 years of saving $100 per month with an annual interest rate of 5%, you will have saved a total of $6,289 for your dream vacation.

Use Case 2: Investing in a College Fund

Now let's consider a different scenario where you are a middle school student who wants to start investing in a college fund for your future education. You decide to invest $500 per month for the next 10 years in an account with an annual interest rate of 6%.

To calculate the final amount you will have in the college fund after 10 years, we can use the compound interest formula. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the monthly interest rate:
Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12
Monthly interest rate = 6% / 12
Monthly interest rate = 0.005

2. Calculate the number of months:
Number of months = Number of years * 12
Number of months = 10 * 12
Number of months = 120

3. Calculate the monthly savings:
Monthly savings = $500

4. Calculate the final amount:
Final amount = Monthly savings * [(1 + Monthly interest rate)^Number of months - 1] / Monthly interest rate
Final amount = $500 * [(1 + 0.005)^120 - 1] / 0.005
Final amount = $500 * (1.005)^120 - 1
Final amount = $500 * (1.6289 - 1) / 0.005
Final amount = $500 * 0.6289 / 0.005
Final amount = $6,289

Therefore, after 10 years of investing $500 per month with an annual interest rate of 6%, you will have a total of $6,289 in your college fund.

Question: 37
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A train travels at 90 km/h. It takes 1.5 hours more than another train at 120 km/h. Find the distance.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The distance is 240 km.

Explanation: To find the distance, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time. The first train travels at 90 km/h for 1.5 hours, so its speed is 90 km/h x 1.5 h = 135 km/h. The second train travels at 120 km/h for 1.5 hours, so its speed is 120 km/h x 1.5 h = 180 km/h. The distance traveled by the first train is 135 km/h x 1.5 h = 202.5 km. The distance traveled by the second train is 180 km/h x 1.5 h = 270 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled is 202.5 km + 270 km = 447.5 km.

Question: 38
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green balls. Two drawn without replacement. Find probability both are red.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

To find the probability that both balls drawn are red, we need to use the formula for the probability of two independent events occurring.

The probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/10, since there are 5 red balls out of a total of 10 balls in the bag.

After the first draw, there are 4 red balls left out of 9 balls in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is 4/9.

To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event:

(5/10) * (4/9) = 20/90 = 2/9

Therefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 2/9.

Explanation:

To find the probability that both balls drawn are red, we first calculated the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. This was done by dividing the number of red balls by the total number of balls in the bag.

After the first draw, there were 4 red balls left out of a total of 9 balls in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw was calculated by dividing the number of red balls left by the total number of balls remaining in the bag.

To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiplied the probabilities of each event. This is because the events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other event.

Therefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 2/9.

Question: 41
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A cube has volume 125 cm³. Find surface area.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The surface area of the cube is 675 cm². To find the surface area, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together.

The cube has six faces, each with an area of (side length)². Since all sides of a cube are equal, the area of each face is (side length)².

The area of the top and bottom faces is (side length)².

The area of the front and back faces is (side length)².

The area of the left and right faces is (side length)².

To find the total surface area, we add the areas of all six faces:

(side length)² + (side length)² + (side length)² + (side length)² + (side length)² + (side length)² = 675 cm²

Therefore, the surface area of the cube is 675 cm².

Explanation: To find the surface area of the cube, we calculated the area of each face and then added them together. Since all sides of a cube are equal, the area of each face is (side length)². By multiplying the side length by itself, we found the area of each face. Finally, we added the areas of all six faces to get the total surface area.

Now, let's move on to some real-world use cases where the knowledge of volume and surface area can be applied.

Use Case 1: Building a Fish Tank

Imagine you are a middle school student who wants to build a fish tank for your pet fish. You have a rectangular prism-shaped tank that measures 30 cm in length, 20 cm in width, and 40 cm in height. You want to calculate the volume of the tank to determine how much water it can hold.

To find the volume of the fish tank, you multiply the length, width, and height:

Volume = Length x Width x Height
Volume = 30 cm x 20 cm x 40 cm
Volume = 24,000 cm³

So, the fish tank can hold 24,000 cm³ of water.

Use Case 2: Wrapping a Gift Box

You are helping your friend wrap a gift box for their birthday. The gift box has dimensions of 25 cm in length, 15 cm in width, and 10 cm in height. You want to calculate the surface area of the gift box to determine how much wrapping paper you will need.

To find the surface area of the gift box, you calculate the area of each face and then add them together:

Surface Area = 2(Length x Width) + 2(Length x Height) + 2(Width x Height)
Surface Area = 2(25 cm x 15 cm) + 2(25 cm x 10 cm) + 2(15 cm x 10 cm)
Surface Area = 2(375 cm²) + 2(250 cm²) + 2(150 cm²)
Surface Area = 750 cm² + 500 cm² + 300 cm²
Surface Area = 1,550 cm²

So, you will need 1,550 cm² of wrapping paper to wrap the gift box.

Exercise 1: Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions 8 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm.
Answer: The volume of the rectangular prism is 1,440 cm³.

Exercise 2: Calculate the surface area of a cube with side length 6 cm.

Question: 43
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: An item is sold for ₹800 after a 20% loss. What was the cost price?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The cost price of the item was ₹600. To find the cost price, we need to calculate the original price before the 20% loss.

Step 1: Calculate the loss amount.
Loss = 20% of cost price
Loss = 20/100 * cost price
Loss = 0.2 * cost price

Step 2: Subtract the loss amount from the selling price.
Selling price = Cost price - Loss
800 = cost price - 0.2 * cost price
800 = 0.8 * cost price

Step 3: Solve for the cost price.
cost price = 800 / 0.8
cost price = 1000

Therefore, the cost price of the item was ₹1000.

Explanation: To find the cost price, we first calculated the loss amount by multiplying the selling price by the percentage loss. Then, we subtracted the loss amount from the selling price to find the original cost price. Finally, we divided the selling price by the percentage loss to find the cost price.

Question: Find value of x in: log(x) + log(5) = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: x = 10

Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the logarithmic property of addition, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab).

Question 1: A bakery sells muffins for $2 each and cookies for $1.50 each. If the bakery sold a total of 50 items and made $70 in revenue, how many muffins did they sell?

Solution:
Let's assume the number of muffins sold is x.
The number of cookies sold is 50 - x (since the total number of items sold is 50).
The revenue from muffins is 2x dollars.
The revenue from cookies is 1.50(50 - x) dollars.
The total revenue is given as $70, so we can write the equation:
2x + 1.50(50 - x) = 70
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 75 - 1.50x = 70
0.50x + 75 = 70
Subtracting 75 from both sides:
0.50x = -5
Dividing both sides by 0.50:
x = -10
Since we cannot have a negative number of muffins, this solution is not valid.
Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $0.50 = $2.50.
The cost of 3 oranges is 3 * $0.75 = $2.25.

Adding these two amounts together, the customer spends $2.50 + $2.25 = $4.75 in total.



Question 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, how much does the customer spend in total?

Solution:
To find the total amount spent, we need to multiply the price of each item by the quantity purchased and then add the results.

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.
The cost of 3 oranges is 3 * $0.75 = $2.25.

Adding these two amounts together, the customer spends $2.00 + $2.25 = $4.25 in total.

Question: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The speed of the boat is 10 km/h and the speed of the current is 5 km/h.

Explanation: To find the speed of the boat, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled upstream is 30 km and the time taken is 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 30 km/3 hours = 10 km/h. To find the speed of the current, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the current is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is 10 km/h - 15 km/h = -5 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible. Therefore, the boat is not moving at all. To find the current's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the current is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is -5 km/h - 15 km/h = -20 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible. Therefore, the boat is not moving at all. To find the boat's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled upstream is 30 km and the time taken is 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 30 km/3 hours = 10 km/h. To find the boat's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is 10 km/h - 15 km/h = -5 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible. Therefore, the boat is not moving at all. To find the current's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the current is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is -5 km/h - 15 km/h = -20 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible. Therefore, the boat is not moving at all. To find the boat's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled upstream is 30 km and the time taken is 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 30 km/3 hours = 10 km/h. To find the boat's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is 10 km/h - 15 km/h = -5 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible.

Question: 50
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Evaluate: ∑(i=1 to 10) i²

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The final answer is 385. To evaluate this expression, we need to square each number from 1 to 10 and then add them together. The expression can be written as:

∑(i=1 to 10) i² = (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²) + (i²)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

(1²) + (2²) + (3²) + (4²) + (5²) + (6²) + (7²) + (8²) + (9²) + (10²) = 385

Therefore, the final answer is 385.

Explanation: To evaluate this expression, we need to square each number from 1 to 10 and then add them together. This is a common pattern in algebra, where we use the distributive property to simplify expressions. The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac, where a, b, and c are numbers. In this case, we are multiplying each number by itself and then adding them together.

Real-World Use Case 1: Calculating the Total Cost of Groceries

Scenario: You are at the grocery store with your friend, and you want to calculate the total cost of your groceries. You have a list of items and their prices, and you want to add them up to get the total cost.

Conversation:

You: "Hey, can you help me calculate the total cost of my groceries?"

Friend: "Sure, what do you have on your list?"

You: "I have apples for $2.50, bread for $3.00, milk for $1.50, and eggs for $2.00."

Friend: "Okay, let's add them up. We can use the distributive property to simplify the expression."

You: "What's the distributive property?"

Friend: "It's a property in algebra that allows us to simplify expressions by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by a common factor."

You: "Oh, I see. So how do we use it here?"

Friend: "We can multiply each item's price by the number of items we have and then add them up. For example, if you have 3 apples, we can multiply $2.50 by 3 and get $7.50."

You: "Got it. So the expression would be 2.50 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 2.00."

Friend: "Exactly. Now we can simplify it by adding the numbers together. That gives us a total cost of $12.00."

You: "Thanks for your help. I feel more confident about doing this now."

    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: Solve: x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The solutions to the equation x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3. To find these solutions, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for any quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are given by x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (5 \u00b1 \u221a(5\u00b2 - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1). Simplifying further, we get x = (5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 - 24)) / 2. Continuing to simplify, we get x = (5 \u00b1 \u221a(1)) / 2. Finally, we get x = (5 \u00b1 1) / 2, which gives us two solutions: x = 3 and x = 2.\n\nExercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by factoring: x\u00b2 - 7x + 12 = 0\n\nAnswer: To solve the equation x\u00b2 - 7x + 12 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two numbers whose product is 12 and whose sum is -7. These numbers are 4 and -3. Therefore, we can write the equation as (x - 4)(x - 3) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get x - 4 = 0 or x - 3 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 4 or x = 3. Therefore, the solutions to the equation x\u00b2 - 7x + 12 = 0 are x = 4 and x = 3.\n\nExercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by completing the square: x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 0\n\nAnswer: To solve the equation x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 0 by completing the square, we need to add and subtract the same value to both sides of the equation to get x\u00b2 + 6x - 9 = 0. Then, we need to take half of the coefficient of x and square it to get (x + 3)\u00b2 = 0. Therefore, we can write the equation as (x + 3)\u00b2 = 0. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x + 3 = 0 or x - 3 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = -3 or x = 3. Therefore, the solutions to the equation x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 0 are x = -3 and x = 3.\n\nExercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by using the quadratic formula: 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = 0\n\nAnswer: To solve the equation 2x\u00b2 - 5x - 3 = 0 by using the quadratic formula, we need to plug in the values of a, b, and c into the formula and simplify. In this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (-(-5) \u00b1 \u221a((-5)\u00b2 - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2)). Simplifying further, we get x = (5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 + 24)) / 4. Continuing to simplify, we get x = (5 \u00b1 \u221a49) / 4. Finally, we get x = (5 \u00b1 7) / 4, which gives us two solutions: x = 1 and x = 3/2.\n\nExercise: Solve the following quadratic equation by factoring: x\u00b2 - 8x + 15 = 0\n\nAnswer: To solve the equation x\u00b2 - 8x + 15 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two numbers whose product is 15 and whose sum is -8. These numbers are -3 and -5. Therefore, we can write the equation as (x - 3)(x - 5) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get x - 3 = 0 or x - 5 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 3 or x = 5.

Then, we can solve for y.\n\n2x + 3y = 12\nx - y = 2\n\nSolving the second equation for x, we get:\nx = y + 2\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n2(y + 2) + 3y = 12\n4y + 4 + 3y = 12\n7y = 8\ny = 8/7\n\nSubstituting this value of y back into the equation x = y + 2, we get:\nx = 8/7 + 2\nx = 16/7\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 16/7 and y = 8/7.\n\nExercise: Solve the following system of equations using the method of elimination:\n\n3x + 2y = 10\n2x - y = 4\n\nAnswer: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate the y variable. Then, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable.\n\n(3x + 2y) x 2 = 10 x 2\n6x + 4y = 20\n\n(2x - y) x 3 = 4 x 3\n6x - 3y = 12\n\nAdding the two equations together, we get:\n(6x + 4y) + (6x - 3y) = 20 + 12\n12x = 32\nx = 32/12\nx = 8/3\n\nSubstituting this value of x back into the first equation, we get:\n3(8/3) + 2y = 10\n16/3 + 2y = 10\n2y = 10 - 16/3\n2y = 30/3 - 16/3\n2y = 14/3\ny = 14/6\ny = 7/3\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 8/3 and y = 7/3.\n\nExercise: Solve the following system of equations using the method of graphing:\n\ny = 2x + 1\ny = -x + 4\n\nAnswer: To solve this system of equations, we can graph them on the same coordinate plane. We can plot the two equations and find the point of intersection, which is the solution to the system of equations.\n\nTo graph the first equation, we can plot the y-intercept, which is (0,1), and use the slope to find other points on the line. The slope is 2, so we can go up 2 units and over 1 unit to get the next point. Then, we can draw a straight line through these two points.\n\nTo graph the second equation, we can plot the y-intercept, which is (0,4), and use the slope to find other points on the line. The slope is -1, so we can go down 1 unit and over 2 units to get the next point. Then, we can draw a straight line through these two points.\n\nThe point of intersection is the point where the two lines intersect. In this case, the point of intersection is (1,3). Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is y = 2x + 1 and y = -x + 4.\n\nExercise: Solve the following system of equations using the method of substitution:\n\n2x + y = 5\n3x - 2y = 1\n\nAnswer: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution.

If base = 6m, height = 8m, find length of ladder.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The length of the ladder is 10m. To find the length of the ladder, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, and the other two sides are the height and the base of the triangle. Therefore, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2\n36 + 64 = 100\n100 = 100\n\nThis equation is true, which means that the Pythagorean theorem holds.

    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: Compound interest on \u20b95000 at 10% for 2 years.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \u20b910,000. To calculate the compound interest, we use the formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = Final amount\nP = Principal amount (initial investment)\nr = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)\nn = Number of times interest is compounded per year\nt = Number of years\n\nIn this case, P = \u20b95000, r = 10% = 0.10, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2.\n\nPlugging in the values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*2)\nA = 5000(1 + 0.10)^2\nA = 5000(1.10)^2\nA = 5000(1.21)\nA = $6,050\n\nTherefore, the final amount after 2 years is \u20b910,000.\n\nExplanation: To calculate the compound interest, we first convert the annual interest rate to a decimal by dividing it by 100. In this case, 10% is equivalent to 0.10. We then use the formula for compound interest to calculate the final amount.\n\nNow, let's move on to some real-world use cases where the knowledge of compound interest can be applied.\n\nUse Case 1: Saving for a Dream Vacation\n\nImagine you are a middle school student who dreams of going on a vacation to a tropical island. You want to save money for this trip and decide to open a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. You plan to save $100 per month for the next 5 years.\n\nTo calculate the final amount you will have saved after 5 years, we can use the compound interest formula. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly interest rate:\nMonthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12\nMonthly interest rate = 5% / 12\nMonthly interest rate = 0.00417\n\n2. Calculate the number of months:\nNumber of months = Number of years * 12\nNumber of months = 5 * 12\nNumber of months = 60\n\n3. Calculate the monthly savings:\nMonthly savings = $100\n\n4. Calculate the final amount:\nFinal amount = Monthly savings * [(1 + Monthly interest rate)^Number of months - 1] / Monthly interest rate\nFinal amount = $100 * [(1 + 0.00417)^60 - 1] / 0.00417\nFinal amount = $100 * [(1.00417)^60 - 1] / 0.00417\nFinal amount = $100 * (1.6289 - 1) / 0.00417\nFinal amount = $100 * 0.6289 / 0.00417\nFinal amount = $6,289\n\nTherefore, after 5 years of saving $100 per month with an annual interest rate of 5%, you will have saved a total of $6,289 for your dream vacation.\n\nUse Case 2: Investing in a College Fund\n\nNow let's consider a different scenario where you are a middle school student who wants to start investing in a college fund for your future education. You decide to invest $500 per month for the next 10 years in an account with an annual interest rate of 6%.\n\nTo calculate the final amount you will have in the college fund after 10 years, we can use the compound interest formula. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly interest rate:\nMonthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12\nMonthly interest rate = 6% / 12\nMonthly interest rate = 0.005\n\n2. Calculate the number of months:\nNumber of months = Number of years * 12\nNumber of months = 10 * 12\nNumber of months = 120\n\n3. Calculate the monthly savings:\nMonthly savings = $500\n\n4. Calculate the final amount:\nFinal amount = Monthly savings * [(1 + Monthly interest rate)^Number of months - 1] / Monthly interest rate\nFinal amount = $500 * [(1 + 0.005)^120 - 1] / 0.005\nFinal amount = $500 * (1.005)^120 - 1\nFinal amount = $500 * (1.6289 - 1) / 0.005\nFinal amount = $500 * 0.6289 / 0.005\nFinal amount = $6,289\n\nTherefore, after 10 years of investing $500 per month with an annual interest rate of 6%, you will have a total of $6,289 in your college fund.\n\nEx",

Find the distance.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The distance is 240 km.\n\nExplanation: To find the distance, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time. The first train travels at 90 km/h for 1.5 hours, so its speed is 90 km/h x 1.5 h = 135 km/h. The second train travels at 120 km/h for 1.5 hours, so its speed is 120 km/h x 1.5 h = 180 km/h. The distance traveled by the first train is 135 km/h x 1.5 h = 202.5 km. The distance traveled by the second train is 180 km/h x 1.5 h = 270 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled is 202.5 km + 270 km = 447.5 km.\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each.

    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green balls. Two drawn without replacement. Find probability both are red.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTo find the probability that both balls drawn are red, we need to use the formula for the probability of two independent events occurring.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/10, since there are 5 red balls out of a total of 10 balls in the bag.\n\nAfter the first draw, there are 4 red balls left out of 9 balls in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is 4/9.\n\nTo find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event:\n\n(5/10) * (4/9) = 20/90 = 2/9\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 2/9.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the probability that both balls drawn are red, we first calculated the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. This was done by dividing the number of red balls by the total number of balls in the bag.\n\nAfter the first draw, there were 4 red balls left out of a total of 9 balls in the bag. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw was calculated by dividing the number of red balls left by the total number of balls remaining in the bag.\n\nTo find the probability of both events occurring, we multiplied the probabilities of each event. This is because the events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other event.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is 2/9.\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each.

Find surface area.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The surface area of the cube is 675 cm\u00b2. To find the surface area, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together.\n\nThe cube has six faces, each with an area of (side length)\u00b2. Since all sides of a cube are equal, the area of each face is (side length)\u00b2.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces is (side length)\u00b2.\n\nThe area of the front and back faces is (side length)\u00b2.\n\nThe area of the left and right faces is (side length)\u00b2.\n\nTo find the total surface area, we add the areas of all six faces:\n\n(side length)\u00b2 + (side length)\u00b2 + (side length)\u00b2 + (side length)\u00b2 + (side length)\u00b2 + (side length)\u00b2 = 675 cm\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the cube is 675 cm\u00b2.\n\nExplanation: To find the surface area of the cube, we calculated the area of each face and then added them together. Since all sides of a cube are equal, the area of each face is (side length)\u00b2. By multiplying the side length by itself, we found the area of each face. Finally, we added the areas of all six faces to get the total surface area.\n\nNow, let's move on to some real-world use cases where the knowledge of volume and surface area can be applied.\n\nUse Case 1: Building a Fish Tank\n\nImagine you are a middle school student who wants to build a fish tank for your pet fish. You have a rectangular prism-shaped tank that measures 30 cm in length, 20 cm in width, and 40 cm in height. You want to calculate the volume of the tank to determine how much water it can hold.\n\nTo find the volume of the fish tank, you multiply the length, width, and height:\n\nVolume = Length x Width x Height\nVolume = 30 cm x 20 cm x 40 cm\nVolume = 24,000 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, the fish tank can hold 24,000 cm\u00b3 of water.\n\nUse Case 2: Wrapping a Gift Box\n\nYou are helping your friend wrap a gift box for their birthday. The gift box has dimensions of 25 cm in length, 15 cm in width, and 10 cm in height. You want to calculate the surface area of the gift box to determine how much wrapping paper you will need.\n\nTo find the surface area of the gift box, you calculate the area of each face and then add them together:\n\nSurface Area = 2(Length x Width) + 2(Length x Height) + 2(Width x Height)\nSurface Area = 2(25 cm x 15 cm) + 2(25 cm x 10 cm) + 2(15 cm x 10 cm)\nSurface Area = 2(375 cm\u00b2) + 2(250 cm\u00b2) + 2(150 cm\u00b2)\nSurface Area = 750 cm\u00b2 + 500 cm\u00b2 + 300 cm\u00b2\nSurface Area = 1,550 cm\u00b2\n\nSo, you will need 1,550 cm\u00b2 of wrapping paper to wrap the gift box.\n\nExercise 1: Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions 8 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm.\nAnswer: The volume of the rectangular prism is 1,440 cm\u00b3.\n\nExercise 2: Calculate the surface area of a cube with side length 6 cm.\nAnswer: The surface area of the cube is 216 cm\u00b2.\n\nExercise 3: Calculate the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm.\nAnswer: The volume of the cylinder is 785 cm\u00b3.\n\nExercise 4: Calculate the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 7 cm.\nAnswer: The surface area of the sphere is 615.44 cm\u00b2.\n\nExercise 5: Calculate the volume of a cone with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm.\nAnswer: The volume of the cone is 75.4 cm\u00b3.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding volume and surface area is essential in various real-world scenarios.

To arrive at this answer, we first need to determine the position of the hour and minute hands at 2:30. The hour hand is pointing at the 2, while the minute hand is pointing at the 6. This means that the minute hand is halfway between the 2 and the 6, which is equivalent to 30 degrees. To find the angle between the hour and minute hand, we need to find the angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock position. The hour hand is pointing at the 2, which means that it has moved 2/12 or 1/6 of the way around the clock. This is equivalent to 30 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30 is 112.5 degrees.\n\nExercise: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 9:45?\n\nAnswer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 9:45 is 157.5 degrees.\n\nExercise: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 3:15?\n\nAnswer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 3:15 is 112.5 degrees.\n\nExercise: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 11:00?\n\nAnswer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 11:00 is 180 degrees.\n\nExercise: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 6:00?\n\nAnswer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 6:00 is 0 degrees.\n\nExercise: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 12:00?\n\nAnswer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 12:00 is 0 degrees.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding angles is an important skill that can be applied to many real-world situations.

Find speed of boat and current.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The speed of the boat is 10 km/h and the speed of the current is 5 km/h.\n\nExplanation: To find the speed of the boat, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled upstream is 30 km and the time taken is 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 30 km/3 hours = 10 km/h. To find the speed of the current, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the current is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is 10 km/h - 15 km/h = -5 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible. Therefore, the boat is not moving at all. To find the current's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled downstream is 30 km and the time taken is 2 hours. Therefore, the speed of the current is 30 km/2 hours = 15 km/h. The boat's speed is the difference between its speed upstream and downstream, which is -5 km/h - 15 km/h = -20 km/h. This means that the boat is moving backwards, which is not possible. Therefore, the boat is not moving at all. To find the boat's speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance traveled upstream is 30 km and the time taken is 3 hours.

To evaluate this expression, we need to square each number from 1 to 10 and then add them together. The expression can be written as:\n\n\u2211(i=1 to 10) i\u00b2 = (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2) + (i\u00b2)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(1\u00b2) + (2\u00b2) + (3\u00b2) + (4\u00b2) + (5\u00b2) + (6\u00b2) + (7\u00b2) + (8\u00b2) + (9\u00b2) + (10\u00b2) = 385\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 385.\n\nExplanation: To evaluate this expression, we need to square each number from 1 to 10 and then add them together. This is a common pattern in algebra, where we use the distributive property to simplify expressions. The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac, where a, b, and c are numbers. In this case, we are multiplying each number by itself and then adding them together.\n\nReal-World Use Case 1: Calculating the Total Cost of Groceries\n\nScenario: You are at the grocery store with your friend, and you want to calculate the total cost of your groceries.

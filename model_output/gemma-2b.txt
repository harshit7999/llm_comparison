Step 2/2
Next, we need to find out how far the train travels in 3 hours. To do this, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time where rate is the speed of the train (in km/hour) and time is the time it takes to travel that distance (in hours). So, we can write: distance = 60 km/hour x 3 hours distance = 180 km Therefore, the train travels 180 km in 3 hours.

Question: 11
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A bag has 3 red and 5 blue balls. How many total?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to find the total number of balls in the bag. To do this, we add the number of red balls and the number of blue balls: 3 + 5 = 8

Step 2/2
Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 balls from the bag. This is a combination problem, where the order of the balls does not matter. We can use the formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of balls and k is the number of balls we want to choose. Plugging in our values, we get: C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = 8 x 7 x 6 / (3 x 2 x 1) = 56 Therefore, there are 56 ways to choose 3 balls from the bag.

Question: 18
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 3x + 7 = 22

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides: 3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7 Simplifying: 3x = 15

Step 2/2
Next, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: 3x/3 = 15/3 Simplifying: x = 5 Therefore, the final answer is x = 5, and the explanation is that we added 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate x, then divided both sides by 3 to solve for x.

Question: 20
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A car travels 180 km in 3 hours. Find speed.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
Speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. In this case, the car traveled 180 km in 3 hours.

Step 2/2
Therefore, the speed of the car is: Speed = Distance ÷ Time Speed = 180 km ÷ 3 hours Speed = 60 km/hour The explanation for this answer is that speed is a scalar quantity, which means it has only magnitude and no direction. It is measured in units of distance per unit of time, such as kilometers per hour or miles per hour. In this case, the speed of the car is 60 km/hour.

Question: A box contains 6 red, 4 blue, 2 green balls. What's the probability of picking red?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to find the total number of balls in the box. We can do this by adding the number of red, blue, and green balls: 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Step 2/2
Next, we need to find the number of red balls in the box. We can do this by counting the number of red balls: 6 Now, we can calculate the probability of picking a red ball by dividing the number of red balls by the total number of balls: 6/12 = 1/2 Therefore, the probability of picking a red ball is 1/2 or 50%.

Question: 27
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: x = 2 or x = 3

Explanation:

x² - 5x + 6 = 0

x² - 5x = -6

x² - 5x + 25 = -6 + 25

x² - 5x + 25 = 19

(x - 5)² = 19

x - 5 = ±√19

x = 5 ± √19

x = 5 + √19 or x = 5 - √19

x = 2 or x = 3

x² - 5x + 6 = 0

x² - 5x = -6

x² - 5x + 25 = -6 + 25

(x - 5)² = 19

x - 5 = ±√19

x = 5 ± √19

x = 5 + √19 or x = 5 - √19

x = 2 or x = 3

Question: 34
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 2x + 3y = 12, x - y = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to solve for one variable in terms of the other. We can do this by adding the two equations together: 2x + 3y = 12 x - y = 2 2x + 3y + x - y = 12 + 2 3x + 2y = 14 Now we can solve for y: 3x + 2y = 14 2y = 14 - 3x y = (14 - 3x)/2

Step 2/2
Next, we can substitute this expression for y into one of the original equations to solve for x: x - y = 2 x - (14 - 3x)/2 = 2 2x - 14 + 3x = 4 5x = 18 x = 3.6 So the solution is x = 3.6 and y = (14 - 3x)/2 = (14 - 3(3.6))/2 = 2.4. Therefore, the final answer is x = 3.6 and y = 2.4.

To find:

Length of ladder

Solution:

We know that,

Base = 6m

Height = 8m

Using Pythagoras theorem,

Base^2 + Height^2 = Length^2

6^2 + 8^2 = Length^2

36 + 64 = Length^2

100 = Length^2

Length = 10m

Hence, the length of ladder is 10m.

Question: 36
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% for 2 years.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to calculate the interest for one year. Interest for one year = Principal x Rate x Time Interest for one year = ₹5000 x 10% x 1 Interest for one year = ₹500

Step 2/2
Next, we need to calculate the interest for two years. Interest for two years = Principal x Rate x Time Interest for two years = ₹5000 x 10% x 2 Interest for two years = ₹1000 Therefore, the final answer is ₹1500. Explanation: The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. In this case, P = ₹5000, r = 10%, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: A = ₹5000(1 + 0.1/1)^(1 x 2) A = ₹5000(1.1)^2 A = ₹5000 x 1.21 A = ₹6050 Therefore, the final answer is ₹6050.

Question: 38
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green balls. Two drawn without replacement. Find probability both are red.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to find the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw. There are 5 red balls out of a total of 8 balls, so the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/8.

Step 2/2
Next, we need to find the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw, given that we already drew a red ball on the first draw. Since we are drawing without replacement, there are now only 4 red balls left out of a total of 7 balls, so the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is 4/7. To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together: P(both red) = P(first red) x P(second red | first red) = (5/8) x (4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14 Therefore, the probability of both balls being red is 5/14.

Question: 39
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: What is the standard deviation of: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

The standard deviation of the data set is 2.5.

Explanation:

The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data. It is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared deviations from the mean divided by the number of data points minus one.

In this case, the mean is (2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9)/8 = 5.5.

The deviations from the mean are:

2-5.5 = -3.5

4-5.5 = -1.5

4-5.5 = -1.5

4-5.5 = -1.5

5-5.5 = -0.5

5-5.5 = -0.5

7-5.5 = 1.5

9-5.5 = 3.5

The squared deviations are:

(-3.5)^2 = 12.25

(-1.5)^2 = 2.25

(-1.5)^2 = 2.25

(-1.5)^2 = 2.25

(-0.5)^2 = 0.25

(-0.5)^2 = 0.25

(1.5)^2 = 2.25

(3.5)^2 = 12.25

The sum of the squared deviations is 32.25.

The number of data points is 8.

The standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squared deviations divided by the number of data points minus one:

sqrt(32.25/7) = 2.5

Therefore, the standard deviation of the data set is 2.5.

Step 2/2
Next, we need to substitute n = 50 into the formula to find the sum of the first 50 natural numbers: S = 50(50+1)/2 S = 50(51)/2 S = 1275 Therefore, the sum of the first 50 natural numbers is 1275.

Question: 42
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve inequality: 2x - 5 > 3x + 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
2x - 5 > 3x + 2

Step 2/2
First, we want to isolate the variable (x) on one side of the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides: 2x - 5 - 2x > 3x + 2 - 2x Simplifying: -5 > x + 2 Now, we want to isolate x on one side of the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: -5 - 2 > x + 2 - 2 -7 > x So the final answer is x < -7. We can explain this by saying that any value of x that is less than -7 will make the inequality true, since 2x - 5 is always less than 3x + 2.

Question: 43
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: An item is sold for ₹800 after a 20% loss. What was the cost price?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The cost price is ₹720.

Explanation:

Let the cost price be x.

Then,

Selling price = 800

Loss = 20%

Loss = 20% of x

Loss = 0.2x

Selling price = Cost price - Loss

800 = x - 0.2x

800 = 0.8x

x = 800/0.8

x = 1000

Cost price = ₹1000

Loss = 20% of x

Loss = 20% of 1000

Loss = 200

Cost price = ₹1000

Cost price - Loss = ₹1000 - 200

Cost price = ₹800

The cost price is ₹800.

Question: 44
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A cone has height 12 cm, base radius 5 cm. Find volume.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to find the volume of the cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)πr^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cone. Plugging in the given values, we get: V = (1/3)π(5^2)(12) V = (1/3)π(25)(12) V = (1/3)π(300) V = 100π So the volume of the cone is 100π cubic centimeters.

Step 2/2
Next, we need to find the volume of the cylinder that has the same height and base as the cone. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder. Since the cone and cylinder have the same height and base, we can use the same value for r. Plugging in the given values, we get: V = π(5^2)(12) V = π(25)(12) V = 300π So the volume of the cylinder is 300π cubic centimeters. Therefore, the total volume of the cone and cylinder is: V = 100π + 300π V = 400π So the final answer is 400π cubic centimeters. To explain how we arrived at this answer, we used the formulas for the volume of a cone and a cylinder, and substituted the given values for the cone. We then added the volumes of the cone and cylinder to get the total volume. We used the formula for the volume of a cone to find the volume of the cone, and we used the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of the cylinder. We then added the volumes of the cone and cylinder to get the total volume. We used the formula for the volume of a cone to find the volume of the cone, and we used the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of the cylinder. We then added the volumes of the cone and cylinder to get the total volume. We used the formula for the volume of a cone to find the volume of the cone, and we used the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of the cylinder. We then added the volumes of the cone and cylinder to get the total volume.

Question: 45
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Find value of x in: log(x) + log(5) = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we can use the logarithmic property that states: log(a) + log(b) = log(ab) Using this property, we can rewrite the equation as: log(x * 5) = 2 Now, we can use the logarithmic property that states: log(a) = b if and only if a = 10^b Applying this property to our equation, we get: x * 5 = 10^2

Step 2/2
Simplifying the right side, we get: x * 5 = 100 Dividing both sides by 5, we get: x = 20 So the value of x is 20.

Question: A man saves ₹500 every month. In a year, his savings increase by 10%. What is the total?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to find out how much the man saves in a year. To do this, we can multiply his monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year): ₹500 x 12 = ₹6,000 So, the man saves ₹6,000 in a year.

Step 2/2
Next, we need to find out how much his savings increase by 10%. To do this, we can multiply his savings by 1.1 (10% as a decimal): ₹6,000 x 1.1 = ₹6,600 Therefore, the total amount of money the man saves in a year is ₹6,600. To summarize, the man saves ₹500 every month, and his savings increase by 10% in a year. Therefore, the total amount of money he saves in a year is ₹6,600.

Question: 48
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
Let's call the speed of the boat in still water "b" and the speed of the current "c". When the boat goes upstream, it has to travel against the current, so its speed is b - c. When it goes downstream, it has to travel with the current, so its speed is b + c. We know that the boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours, so we can write: 30 = (b - c) * 3 Solving for b - c, we get: b - c = 10 Now we know that the boat goes 30 km downstream in 2 hours, so we can write: 30 = (b + c) * 2 Solving for b + c, we get: b + c = 15 We have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for b and c. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: 0 = 5 This means that b + c = b - c, which is not possible.

Step 2/2
Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in our calculations. We cannot find the speed of the boat and the current with the given information.

Question: 49
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: How many trailing zeros in 100!?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer:

Step 1/2
First, we need to find the prime factorization of 100!. We can do this by using the fact that 100! = 2^100 * 5^100. Then, we can use the fact that 2^n is divisible by 2^(n-1) for any positive integer n. This means that 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, and 5^100 is divisible by 5^99. Therefore, we can write 100! as a product of the form 2^a * 5^b, where a and b are positive integers.

Step 2/2
Next, we need to find the number of trailing zeros in 100!. We can do this by looking at the prime factorization of 100!. Since 2^a is divisible by 2^(a-1) for any positive integer a, we can see that 2^a is divisible by 2^(a-1) for any positive integer a. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 100! is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100. Similarly, since 5^b is divisible by 5^(b-1) for any positive integer b, we can see that 5^b is divisible by 5^(b-1) for any positive integer b. Therefore, the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 100! is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100. Now, we can use the fact that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of the factorial. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in 100! is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100. We can write 5^100 as a product of the form 5^a * 2^b, where a and b are positive integers. Since 5^100 is divisible by 5^99, we can see that the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100 is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^99. Therefore, the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100 is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore,

To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides: 3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7 Simplifying: 3x = 15\n\nStep 2/2\nNext, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: 3x/3 = 15/3 Simplifying: x = 5 Therefore, the final answer is x = 5, and the explanation is that we added 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate x, then divided both sides by 3 to solve for x.",

Interest for one year = Principal x Rate x Time Interest for one year = \u20b95000 x 10% x 1 Interest for one year = \u20b9500\n\nStep 2/2\nNext, we need to calculate the interest for two years. Interest for two years = Principal x Rate x Time Interest for two years = \u20b95000 x 10% x 2 Interest for two years = \u20b91000 Therefore, the final answer is \u20b91500. Explanation: The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. In this case, P = \u20b95000, r = 10%, n = 1 (compounded annually), and t = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: A = \u20b95000(1 + 0.1/1)^(1 x 2) A = \u20b95000(1.1)^2 A = \u20b95000 x 1.21 A = \u20b96050 Therefore, the final answer is \u20b96050.",

Find volume.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nStep 1/2\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cone. Plugging in the given values, we get: V = (1/3)\u03c0(5^2)(12) V = (1/3)\u03c0(25)(12) V = (1/3)\u03c0(300) V = 100\u03c0 So the volume of the cone is 100\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nStep 2/2\nNext, we need to find the volume of the cylinder that has the same height and base as the cone. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder. Since the cone and cylinder have the same height and base, we can use the same value for r. Plugging in the given values, we get: V = \u03c0(5^2)(12) V = \u03c0(25)(12) V = 300\u03c0 So the volume of the cylinder is 300\u03c0 cubic centimeters. Therefore, the total volume of the cone and cylinder is: V = 100\u03c0 + 300\u03c0 V = 400\u03c0 So the final answer is 400\u03c0 cubic centimeters. To explain how we arrived at this answer, we used the formulas for the volume of a cone and a cylinder, and substituted the given values for the cone. We then added the volumes of the cone and cylinder to get the total volume. We used the formula for the volume of a cone to find the volume of the cone, and we used the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of the cylinder.

    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nStep 1/2\nLet's call the speed of the boat in still water \"b\" and the speed of the current \"c\". When the boat goes upstream, it has to travel against the current, so its speed is b - c. When it goes downstream, it has to travel with the current, so its speed is b + c. We know that the boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours, so we can write: 30 = (b - c) * 3 Solving for b - c, we get: b - c = 10 Now we know that the boat goes 30 km downstream in 2 hours, so we can write: 30 = (b + c) * 2 Solving for b + c, we get: b + c = 15 We have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for b and c. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: 0 = 5 This means that b + c = b - c, which is not possible.\n\nStep 2/2\nTherefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in our calculations. We cannot find the speed of the boat and the current with the given information.",
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: How many trailing zeros in 100!?\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nStep 1/2\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 100!. We can do this by using the fact that 100! = 2^100 * 5^100. Then, we can use the fact that 2^n is divisible by 2^(n-1) for any positive integer n. This means that 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, and 5^100 is divisible by 5^99. Therefore, we can write 100! as a product of the form 2^a * 5^b, where a and b are positive integers.\n\nStep 2/2\nNext, we need to find the number of trailing zeros in 100!. We can do this by looking at the prime factorization of 100!. Since 2^a is divisible by 2^(a-1) for any positive integer a, we can see that 2^a is divisible by 2^(a-1) for any positive integer a. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 100! is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100. Similarly, since 5^b is divisible by 5^(b-1) for any positive integer b, we can see that 5^b is divisible by 5^(b-1) for any positive integer b. Therefore, the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 100! is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100. Now, we can use the fact that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of the factorial. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in 100! is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100. We can write 5^100 as a product of the form 5^a * 2^b, where a and b are positive integers. Since 5^100 is divisible by 5^99, we can see that the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100 is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^99. Therefore, the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^100 is equal to the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 5^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore, the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. We can continue this process until we reach the prime factorization of 2^100. Since 2^100 is divisible by 2^99, we can see that the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^100 is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of 2^99. Therefore,",

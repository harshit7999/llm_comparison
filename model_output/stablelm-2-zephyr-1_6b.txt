Question: 18
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 3x + 7 = 22

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: 

To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we first need to isolate the variable x by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation. 

3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7 

This simplifies to: 

3x = 15 

Next, we need to get rid of the coefficient 3 by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. 

(3x) / 3 = 15 / 3 

This simplifies to: 

x = 5 

So, the solution to the equation 3x + 7 = 22 is x = 5. 

Explanation: 

To isolate x, we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation. This is because the left side of the equation represents the sum of 3x and 7, and by subtracting 7, we are effectively subtracting 7 times the coefficient 3 from the sum. 

After subtracting 7, we are left with: 

3x = 22 - 7 

This simplifies to: 

3x = 15 

Next, we need to get rid of the coefficient 3 by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. 

(3x) / 3 = 15 / 3 

This simplifies to: 

x = 5 

So, the solution to the equation 3x + 7 = 22 is x = 5. This means that when we substitute x = 5 back into the original equation, the left side of the equation should equal 22, which it does. 

Therefore, the solution to the equation 3x + 7 = 22 is x = 5.

Question: A car travels 180 km in 3 hours. Find speed.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The speed of the car is 56 km/h.

Explanation: To find the speed, we can use the formula speed = distance/time. In this case, the distance is 180 km and the time is 3 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

speed = 180 km / 3 hours

speed = 60 km/h

However, since the speed is given in km/h, we need to convert the result to km per hour. To do this, we can divide the speed by 3, since there are 3 hours in the given time:

speed = 60 km/h / 3

speed = 20 km/h

Therefore, the speed of the car is 20 km/h.

Explanation: To find the probability of picking a red ball, we need to know the total number of balls in the box. In this case, there are 6 red balls and a total of 10 balls (6 red + 4 blue + 2 green). To find the probability, we divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls: 6/10. This simplifies to 3/5, which is the final answer. The probability of picking a red ball is higher than the average probability of picking a red ball in a standard 5-sided die (which is 1/6) because there are more red balls in the box.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

12 = 2^2 * 3
18 = 2 * 3^2
24 = 2^3 * 3

Next, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:

2^3 (from 24)
3^2 (from 18)

Finally, we multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:

72 = 2^3 * 3^2

Therefore, the LCM of 12, 18, and 24 is 72.

Question: 26
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A pie chart shows 40% red, 30% blue, 30% green. If there are 200 people, how many prefer blue?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: Out of the 200 people, 60 people (30% of 200) prefer blue. 

Explanation: We know that the pie chart shows 40% red, 30% blue, and 30% green. If we add up the percentages of each color, we get 40% + 30% + 30% = 100%. This means that the total percentage of people who could potentially prefer blue is 100%. 

To find out how many people actually prefer blue, we need to subtract the percentage of people who prefer red (40%) and green (30%) from the total percentage. So, 100% - 40% - 30% = 30%. This means that 30% of people prefer blue. 

To find out how many people prefer blue, we multiply the percentage by the total number of people: 30% * 200 = 60 people. Therefore, 60 people prefer blue.

Question: 34
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve: 2x + 3y = 12, x - y = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The solution to the system of linear equations is the point that satisfies both equations simultaneously. To find the solution, we can use either substitution or elimination method.

Using the elimination method, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the variable x:

2(x - y) = 2(2)

This simplifies to:

2x - 2y = 4

Now, we can add the two equations together to eliminate y:

(2x + 3y) + (2x - 2y) = 12 + 4

This simplifies to:

4x = 16

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 4:

x = 4

Substituting this value of x back into either of the original equations, we can solve for y:

2(4) + 3y = 12
8 + 3y = 12
3y = 4
y = 4/3
y = 4/3

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is (x, y) = (4, 4/3).

Question: A ladder leans against a wall forming a right triangle. If base = 6m, height = 8m, find length of ladder.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The length of the ladder can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this case, the base of the ladder is 6 meters and the height is 8 meters. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the ladder as follows:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2
c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2
c^2 = 36 + 64
c^2 = 100
c = √100
c = 10√3

So, the length of the ladder is 10√3 meters.

Explanation: The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the base of the ladder is 6 meters and the height is 8 meters. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the ladder as follows:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2
c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2
c^2 = 36 + 64
c^2 = 100
c = √100
c = 10√3

Therefore, the length of the ladder is 10√3 meters.

Question: Compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% for 2 years.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% for 2 years is ₹683.14.

Explanation: To calculate compound interest, we use the formula:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the final amount (including interest)
P = principal amount (₹5000)
r = annual interest rate (10% or 0.10 as a decimal)
n = number of times interest is compounded per year (1 or 1/1000 as a decimal)
t = time (2 years)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 5000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*2)
A = 5000(1 + 0.10)^2
A = 5000(1.10)^2
A = 5000(1.21)
A = ₹683.14

Therefore, the compound interest on ₹5000 at 10% for 2 years is ₹683.14.

Question: 37
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A train travels at 90 km/h. It takes 1.5 hours more than another train at 120 km/h. Find the distance.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The total distance traveled by the trains is 130 km.

Explanation: To find the total distance traveled by both trains, we first need to find the combined speed of both trains. The combined speed is the sum of the speeds of the two trains. 

The first train travels at 90 km/h and the second train travels at 120 km/h. 

Combined speed = 90 km/h + 120 km/h = 210 km/h.

Now, we know that the first train takes 1.5 hours more than the second train. 

Let's assume the time taken by the second train is x hours. 

Then, the time taken by the first train would be x + 1.5 hours.

Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can find the distance traveled by each train.

Distance traveled by the first train = speed × time = 210 km/h × (x + 1.5) hours.

Distance traveled by the second train = speed × time = 120 km/h × x hours.

Since both trains travel the same distance, we can equate the two expressions for distance:

210 km/h × (x + 1.5) hours = 120 km/h × x hours.

Now, we can solve for x:

210x + 315 = 120x

390 = 80x

x = 390 / 80

x = 4.875 hours

Now, we can find the distance traveled by the first train:

Distance traveled by the first train = 210 km/h × 4.875 hours

Distance traveled by the first train = 116.25 km

Finally, we can find the total distance traveled by both trains:

Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train

Total distance = 116.25 km + 120 km

Total distance = 236.25 km

Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains is 236.25 km.

Question: 38
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, 2 green balls. Two drawn without replacement. Find probability both are red.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The probability that the first ball drawn is red and the second ball drawn is also red is 5/14 (or 2/7) since there are 5 red balls out of a total of 8 balls, and the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/8.

Explanation: To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities. In this case, the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/8, and the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is 5/14 (since there are 5 red balls out of a total of 8 balls). Therefore, the probability of both events happening is 5/8 * 5/14 = 25/56, which simplifies to 5/7.

Question: 39
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: What is the standard deviation of: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The standard deviation of the given set of numbers is 1.57.

Explanation: To find the standard deviation, we first need to calculate the mean (average) of the numbers. The mean is found by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total number of values. In this case, the mean is (2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9)/9 = 10. 

Next, we calculate the standard deviation by subtracting the mean from the given set of numbers and then taking the square root of the result. The formula for calculating the standard deviation is √[(n-1)*s^2], where n is the total number of values and s is the average of the values. 

Plugging in the values, we get √[(9-10)^2] = √[(-1)^2] = 1. 

Therefore, the standard deviation is 1.57, which means that there is a 1.57 unit range in the data from 2 to 9.

You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Find the sum of first 50 natural numbers.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The sum of the first 50 natural numbers is 15,595.

Explanation: To find the sum of the first 50 natural numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is:

Sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2

where n is the number of terms (in this case, 50).

Plugging in the values, we get:

Sum = (50 * (50 + 1)) / 2
Sum = (50 * 51) / 2
Sum = 2550 / 2
Sum = 1275

Therefore, the sum of the first 50 natural numbers is 12,750. However, since the question asks for the sum of the first 50 natural numbers, we round down to 15,595.

Question: 41
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A cube has volume 125 cm³. Find surface area.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: Surface Area of a cube is given by 6 * (side length)^2. Since the volume of the cube is 125 cm³, the side length can be found by dividing the volume by the cube's formula for volume, which is s^3. Therefore, the side length is √125 = 5 cm.

Now, we can calculate the surface area of the cube using the formula mentioned above. Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2 = 6 * (5)^2 = 6 * 25 = 150 square cm.

Explanation: To find the surface area of a cube, we first need to determine the side length. The formula for the volume of a cube is s^3, where s is the side length. In this case, the volume is given as 125 cm³, so we can find the side length by dividing the volume by the cube's formula for volume. The side length is √125 = 5 cm. Once we have the side length, we can calculate the surface area by multiplying the side length by itself (6 * (side length)^2). The final surface area is 150 square cm.

You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Solve inequality: 2x - 5 > 3x + 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The solution to the inequality 2x - 5 > 3x + 2 is x > 6/2 or x > 3.

Explanation: To solve this inequality, we first need to isolate the variable x on one side of the inequality sign. We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides of the inequality sign. This gives us:

2x - 5 > 3x + 2

Next, we can simplify the left side of the inequality by combining like terms:

2x - 3x - 5 > 2x - 3x + 2

This simplifies to:

-x - 5 > 2

Now, we can isolate the variable x by adding 5 to both sides of the inequality:

-x > 2 + 5

Next, we can simplify the right side of the inequality by combining like terms:

-x > 7

Finally, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the inequality by -1:

x < -7

Therefore, the solution to the inequality 2x - 5 > 3x + 2 is x < -7. This inequality is satisfied when x is less than -7.

Question: A cone has height 12 cm, base radius 5 cm. Find volume.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

Using the given values, we can plug in the values for r and h into the formula:

V = (1/3)π(5^2)(12)

Simplifying the expression:

V = (1/3)π(25)(12)

V = (1/3)(312.5π)

V = 104.163π

Therefore, the volume of the cone is 104.163π cubic centimeters.

Explanation: We used the formula for the volume of a cone, which is V = (1/3)πr^2h. We then plugged in the given values for the radius (5 cm) and height (12 cm) into the formula to find the volume (104.163π cubic centimeters).

Question: 45
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: Find value of x in: log(x) + log(5) = 2

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The solution to the equation log(x) + log(5) = 2 can be obtained using the properties of logarithms. 

Using the property log(a) + log(b) = log(a/b), we can rewrite the equation as log(x/5) = 2. 

Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5: 

5 * log(x/5) = 2 * 5 

This simplifies to: 

log(x) = 10 

Now, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form: 

x = 10^1 

Therefore, the value of x is 10. 

Explanation: We used the property of logarithms, specifically the property log(a) + log(b) = log(a/b). We then applied this property to the given equation to isolate the term with x. By doing so, we were able to solve for x in exponential form.

Question: A man saves ₹500 every month. In a year, his savings increase by 10%. What is the total?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The man saves ₹500 every month, and his savings increase by 10% annually. To calculate the total savings after the increase, we first need to find 10% of his monthly savings.

10% of ₹500 = (10/100) * ₹500 = ₹50

Now, we add this increase to his original monthly savings:

Final savings = ₹500 (original) + ₹50 (increase) = ₹550

Therefore, the man's total savings after the increase in a year is ₹550.

You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: What's the angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30?

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30 is 150 degrees.

Explanation: To find the angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30, we can use the following formula:

angle = (hour - 10) x 30 + (minute - 12) x 6

Plugging in the given values, we get:

angle = (2 - 10) x 30 + (30 - 12) x 6
angle = -8 x 30 + 18 x 6
angle = -240 + 108
angle = -132

Since the angle is negative, we can add 360 degrees to get the correct angle:

angle = -132 + 360
angle = 228

Therefore, the angle between the hour and minute hand at 2:30 is 228 degrees.

Question: 48
You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.

Question: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The speed of the boat is 12 km/h and the current is 1 km/h.

Explanation: To find the speed of the boat, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is the 30 km that the boat goes upstream and the time is 3 hours. So, the speed of the boat is:

Speed = 30 km / 3 hours = 10 km/h

Since the boat returns downstream, we can use the same formula but with the opposite direction:

Speed = -Distance / -Time

In this case, the distance is the 30 km that the boat goes downstream and the time is 2 hours. So, the speed of the boat going downstream is:

Speed = -30 km / 2 hours = -15 km/h

To find the current, we can use the formula:

Current = Speed / Distance

In this case, the distance is the 30 km that the boat goes upstream and the speed is 10 km/h. So, the current is:

Current = 10 km/h / 30 km = 1/3 km/h

Therefore, the current is 1/3 km/h and the speed of the boat is 12 km/h.

Instruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

Answer: The sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10 is equal to 385.

Explanation: To find the sum of the squares, we can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, which is given by:

Sum = (n*(n+1))/2

In this case, n = 10, so the formula becomes:

Sum = (10*(10+1))/2 = 55

However, this formula only gives us the sum of the squares up to the 10th term. To find the sum of the squares for all terms from 1 to 10, we can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, which is given by:

Sum = (n*(n+1))/2

In this case, n = 10, so the formula becomes:

Sum = (10*(10+1))/2 = 55

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 385, which is the result obtained by adding 55 (the sum of the squares of the first 10 terms) to the previous result.

    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: A boat goes 30 km upstream in 3 hours and returns in 2. Find speed of boat and current.\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The speed of the boat is 12 km/h and the current is 1 km/h.\n\nExplanation: To find the speed of the boat, we can use the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nIn this case, the distance is the 30 km that the boat goes upstream and the time is 3 hours. So, the speed of the boat is:\n\nSpeed = 30 km / 3 hours = 10 km/h\n\nSince the boat returns downstream, we can use the same formula but with the opposite direction:\n\nSpeed = -Distance / -Time\n\nIn this case, the distance is the 30 km that the boat goes downstream and the time is 2 hours. So, the speed of the boat going downstream is:\n\nSpeed = -30 km / 2 hours = -15 km/h\n\nTo find the current, we can use the formula:\n\nCurrent = Speed / Distance\n\nIn this case, the distance is the 30 km that the boat goes upstream and the speed is 10 km/h. So, the current is:\n\nCurrent = 10 km/h / 30 km = 1/3 km/h\n\nTherefore, the current is 1/3 km/h and the speed of the boat is 12 km/h.",

This means that 10 is a factor 3 times (2^3) and 5 times (5^2). Therefore, there are 10 trailing zeros in 100!.\n\nIn general, the number of trailing zeros in a factorial number n! is equal to the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of n.",
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers the following question accurately and concisely.\n\nQuestion: Evaluate: \u2211(i=1 to 10) i\u00b2\n\nInstruction: Provide the final answer and include an explanation of how you arrived at the answer.\n\nAnswer: The sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10 is equal to 385.\n\nExplanation: To find the sum of the squares, we can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, which is given by:\n\nSum = (n*(n+1))/2\n\nIn this case, n = 10, so the formula becomes:\n\nSum = (10*(10+1))/2 = 55\n\nHowever, this formula only gives us the sum of the squares up to the 10th term. To find the sum of the squares for all terms from 1 to 10, we can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, which is given by:\n\nSum = (n*(n+1))/2\n\nIn this case, n = 10, so the formula becomes:\n\nSum = (10*(10+1))/2 = 55\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 385, which is the result obtained by adding 55 (the sum of the squares of the first 10 terms) to the previous result."
